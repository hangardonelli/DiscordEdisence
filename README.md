# DiscordEdiSence

I was looking for some script that could put Vim Rich Presence on the internet, and I was surprised that none existed for Windows! (all were for linux). So I decided to do it myself.


I didn't bother to come up with a name for this project, basically DiscordEdiSence is a contraction of the phrase "**Dis**co**rd** **Co**de **Edi**tor Pre**sence**"

Currently it brings support for the following code editors, but if some charitable soul prefers to enlarge this list that would be very good :)

 

 
 - VIM
 - Notepad++
 - Visual Studio Code
